# Dotfiles for a i3wm setup.

Use `stow --dotfiles <folder-name>` to setup links to the configuration, remember to have this repo in `~/dotfiles` or you will have to search for and correct the links accordingly.

You can only use one of `i3` or `i3min` for a full blown setup or a minimalist setup.


Thank you!
